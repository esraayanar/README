## About Me

Hello! I'm Esra Yanar, an ambitious and enthusiastic IT professional and data analyst from San Diego, California. With a Master's degree in Information Technology and Data Analytics and a Bachelor’s in Mathematics, my educational journey has equipped me to tackle challenges at the intersection of technology, business, and data analysis.

## My Interests in Information Technology

I am deeply passionate about exploring the vast realms of Computer Science, Business, and Data Analytics. My professional focus is on utilizing technology to enhance organizational efficiency and decision-making through robust data analysis and IT solutions.

## Utilizing GitHub and Cloud Computing

### GitHub

GitHub is an integral tool in my professional toolkit. It supports my objectives in several ways:
- **Project Management**: I use GitHub for version control and project management, ensuring that all changes and iterations in my projects are well-documented and collaborative efforts are synchronized.
- **Showcasing Work**: My GitHub repositories serve as a dynamic portfolio that demonstrates my skills in coding, system analysis, and project development.
- **Learning and Sharing**: GitHub allows me to connect with a global community of developers, sharing knowledge and learning from others' experiences and contributions.

### Cloud Computing

My interest in cloud computing stems from its transformative impact on data management and application scalability. Here’s how I use cloud computing:
- **Data Storage and Analysis**: Utilizing cloud platforms for secure data storage and powerful computing capabilities that allow me to perform complex data analyses and host large databases.
- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Implementing cloud services to manage and configure virtual servers, which helps in deploying scalable applications without the need for physical hardware.
- **Tools and Applications**: Employing cloud-based tools to facilitate remote collaboration and enhance productivity in project management and data visualization.

## Current Projects

- **IT Systems Enhancement**: At Episcopal Community Services, I am involved in analyzing and interpreting system data to optimize workflows and update IT policies.
- **Data Visualization Initiatives**: Developing dashboards and reports using Power BI to facilitate data-driven decision-making processes.

## Future Aspirations

I plan to further explore cloud computing technologies to enhance my ability to deploy and manage scalable applications efficiently. Additionally, I aim to deepen my knowledge in machine learning to broaden my analytical capabilities in predictive analytics.
